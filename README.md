# Knight's tour

This project shows the famous knight's tour in chess .

## What is a knight's tour

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed ; otherwise, it is open .
